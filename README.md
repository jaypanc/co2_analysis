# $CO_2$ analysis
A shiny app for analysis of co2 and other factors affecting environment for different countries and continents on different timelines.

## Dataset
dataset contains yearly records of $CO_2$ levels and other factors affecting level of $CO_2$ for 170+ countries,continents and overall world over a period of time from 1950 to 2020.
some of the features of the dataset are :  
    1.  overall $CO_2$  
    2. $CO_2$ generated by trading  
    3. $CO_2$ generated by cement  
    4. $CO_2$ generated by coal  
    etc...

## Preview of webapp  


* On this tab, you can select a feature and a timeline to see how a continent is contributing to $CO_2$ pollution in that timeline. We can also cumulative contribution of a continent.    

![second tab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66965333/170456609-fb78e0e6-b15b-4625-8015-9eacdb57646a.png)
  
 
* you can select different countries and a parameter with specific timeline. That will generate a plot. Selecting a specific part of plot will give you all data points of the selected region which has basic filtering options.    
  
![third tab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66965333/170531602-10e77d2f-016e-489c-8646-b8ccc6034879.png)
  
* In the last tab, you can get the most and the least contributing countries to selected feature.

## Results 

Average $CO_2$ levels of continents


| Continent | $CO_2$ |
| --- | --- |
| Asia | 2821 |
| North America |2025 |
| Europe |1960 |
| Africa |348 |
| South America |316 |
| Oceania |130 |
| Antarctica |102 |

Values of Asia, North America and Europe do not show a big difference but A Welch T-Test(unequal variance) shows that there is **significant difference in mean of Asia & North America and Asia and Europe but there is no difference in North America and Europe.** Just looking at mean values can be confusing so looking at total values of $CO_2$ for continents from 1900 to 2020.

When you look at values of Asia specifically, 46.18% of $CO_2$ pollution is done by China and India combined. It might show that India is as pollutant as China.
  
| Continent | $CO_2$ (total values) |
| --- | --- |
| Asia | 538810 |
| Asia excluding China and India | 248829 |

Diggind deep for China and India:

| Country | $CO_2$ (total values) |
| --- | --- |
| China | 236100 |
| India | 57363 |

The numbers here clearly shows that **China is responsible for most of pollution in Asia**. Talking numbers, there might be mismatch of sum this is due to years not being accounted. 

Looking data of North America,

| Continent | $CO_2$ (total values) |
| --- | --- |
| North America | 477802 |
| North America excluding USA | 61078 |

This shows that USA is major reason for $CO_2$ pollution in North America.  

Comparing countries with most GDP shares(values are in descending order of $CO_2$ emission) from 1900 to 2020,


| Country | $CO_2$ (total values) |
| --- | --- |
| United States | 406721 |
| China | 236100 |
| Germany | 86572 |
| Japan | 65465 |
| United Kingdom | 61837 |
| India | 54313 |
| France | 35147 |
| Canada | 33316 |
| Italy | 24494 |
| Brazil | 16239 |
